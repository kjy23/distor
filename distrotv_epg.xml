    <title>NEW League of Legends Champion Renata Glasc ABILITIES REVEALED</title>
    <desc>Even though she looks like she was ripped straight out of Arcane, technically, Renata Glasc, the Chem Baroness, wasn’t. She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc>

    <title>"Veganity": World's largest vegan restaurant opened in Dubai</title>
    <desc>There is an undeniable trend towards a plant-based diet. In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the worlds largest vegan restaurant (‘Veganity’) has just opened its doors. Veganity’s founder Sky Sommer’s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice. With over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer’s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt. “Its actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.” Below weve provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home. Recipe Laham Ajeen Chop tomatoes x4 Diced onions x2 Garlic diced x8 Parsley chopped x1 bunch Red capsicum small squares x1 Green capsicum small squares x1 Minced meat (TVP) 250g Cook all together with 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil for around 10 minutes then add the spices below until they are well combined: Paprika x 4 tablespoons 7 spices x 4 tablespoons Garlic powder x 2 tablespoons Vegan Worcester sauce x 1 tablespoons Tomato paste x 4 tablespoons Vegetable stock x 1 cup Leave to marinate for up to 1 hour stirring it every 15 min till all liquids have dissolved then serve with half a lemon slice.

    <title>Discover the supersized attractions of Downtown Dubai, starting with the world’s tallest building</title>
    <desc>Downtown Dubai’s ample attractions include a 10-million litre aquarium, an Olympic-sized ice rink and the world’s tallest building. Nothing can prepare visitors for the true scale of record-breaking  Burj Khalifa . At twice the height of the Empire State Building and almost three times the size of the Eiffel Tower, it soars 828 metres into the sky. Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever  hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148.  Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door,  The Dubai Mall  houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast  Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo  and Dubai Mall’s indoor  ice rink  is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest  VR Park  in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes.   Bustling with entertainment, Downtown Dubai’s high-octane epicentre is looped by the laidback, café-lined Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Boulevard – a starting point for a public art trail. Downtown Dubai is an urban canvas of sculptures</desc>

    <title>Mrs. Pound</title>
    <desc>Dont judge a book by its cover, this is not your average stamp shop. Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience. We like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Milk Tea Cake, Sriracha Street Corn, and Lemongrass Pork Chop. Although it will be a longer wait, do yourself a favor and go for dinner for the best experience.</desc>

    <title>Panoramic Paramotoring</title>
    <desc>It consists of a tricycle, an engine powering a propeller that fills a canopy and - thankfully- a back-up canopy.  One of the smallest aircraft in the world, Paramotors are the latest way to take to the skies above Dubais sand dunes.  And as its wing rises, so does Euronews James OHagans nerves: "My pilot Jos assures me he’s never needed it ( the backup wing)." The morning mist clears and Jos Vandenbroucke, General manager pf Paramotor Desert Adventure, has given the word to go ahead. "Ready for rock and roll? he says. "We’re like 40/50 metres. No more. We can easily go up to 12,000 feet. In case we have an engine failure, it’s just doing this (Jos turns off engine)." Paramotors are one of the smallest aircraft in the world and have a great safety record because the engine is only needed for gaining altitude and can be switched off when you come back down to land. "We will do a spiral. If you can’t hold it anymore James, you just shout." "Now we do a 360 to the right. Yalla, here we go!" "The G-force in your stomach is class!" says OHagan. Flying over a stretch of desert reserve, you can see an array of wildlife; families of camels, Arabian oryx and even a tower of giraffes. "After that, I think I can safely say that I’ve got over my fear of flying and kiss the ground," says OHagan.</desc>

    <title>Jilsiru Tteok Cafe</title>
    <desc>At first blush, the Jilsiru Tteok Cafe may strike more adventurous explorers as a bit of a snoozefest. Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served . Just make sure you come brave enough to try the dried manta ray.</desc>

    <title>What to do in Pompano Beach</title>
    <desc>One of South Florida’s hidden gems is Pompano Beach, Florida. Located just north of Fort Lauderdale, this quiet beach town is perfect for those who prefer less crowds and a laid back atmosphere. It’s ideal location makes access to other South Florida towns, including Miami, super easy. I start my journey at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Pompano Beach Resort &amp; Spa. It has the most amazing sunrises which I delighted in each day from my private balcony. The hotel is located directly on the beach which makes it very difficult to leave. I visit the charming beachside town of Lauderdale by the Sea, a 10 minute drive from my hotel. I also take a tour at Butterfly World, the first and largest butterfly house in the United States. It is home over 80 species of butterflies, hummingbird and lorikeet aviaries, and outdoor gardens. This place is truly magical for people of all ages. Pompano Beach is the quintessential beach town. You can truly relax and enjoy the beach at your own pace while indulging as much or as little as you’d like.</desc>

    <title>Sak Yant Tattoo</title>
    <desc>Traditional hand needle tattoos have been a staple of Thai culture for centuries with the common practitioners being Buddhist monks. Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc>

    <title>Adventures – Explore, dive and discover the sealife in Dubai’s waters</title>
    <desc>An hour and a half away from the city of Dubai, Euronews James OHagan joined the Dubai-based centre Divers Down to complete his PADI training and have his first proper dive. Michela Colella, Operations Manager, Divers Down UAE said, "We will go to an average depth of 14 metres. We’ll look for trumpet fish, triggerfish, clownfish, pufferfish, boxfish." Even with the basic training completed, diving with an instructor helps you feel safer, develop the right habits, and take in all the best spots on the dive site. Some of the most spectacular coral and marine life are located just 5 metres from the surface. At that depth, everything is lit up beautifully and the air lasts much longer than at 10 or 15 metres. The reef has species ranging from stingrays to lobsters, jawfish, parrotfish, broomtail wrasse, and many others. For more experienced divers there are dozens of shipwrecks and artificial reefs to explore each with unique histories and coral formations. At times it feels as if you’re flying in slow motion in some sort of alien landscape. And before you know it, it’s time to come back to the real world. Euronews James OHagan exclaimed, "Oh! That was incredible! Breathtaking!</desc>

Hong Kong sits atop the throne as the city with the most skyscrapers in the world, yet the urbanized areas are only a fraction of the city itself. The nature that surrounds and pushes through the city, gives Hong Kong it’s true indescribable magic. Denizens know where to find the hiking trails, the views, and escape routes to the open sea. The endless culinary delights, bold experiences, and hidden treasures make Hong Kong a torchbearer of culture, innovation, and lifestyle in Asia.</desc>

    <title>Did you know Dubai is fifth most instagrammed city in the world?</title>
    <desc>Dubai has been named the 5th most Instagrammed city in the world in a survey by travel site Wego. From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational," she explains. "It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So, you’re looking for something that is bright, that real</desc>

    <title>Kanda Myojin</title>
    <desc>Located in Chiyoda, this Shinto shrine has been watching over the neighborhoods of Kanda, Nihonbashi, Akihabara, Ootemachi, Marunouchi and others since the 14th century. Although the Gate of God suffered the fires, earthquakes and wars over the years, the rebuilt pavilion — decked out in stunning vermillion and gold with lacquered interiors — still attracts worshipers and visitors alike. Like the Kanda area itself, the shrine celebrates its history but also looks to the future. On any given day, you’ll find a mix of businessmen praying to the gods for luck and prosperity, young brides wishing for a good marriage, and others simply trying to ward of bad vibes. But the shrine’s priests started reaching out to younger generations with anime characters and charms that look like SD cards. Every other May, the shrine becomes a centerpiece for Kanda Matsuri, one of Tokyo’s most famous festivals since the Edo period. Locals parade with their favorite deities, or kami, through the neighborhoods, making their way to the shrine for the ultimate bash. If you think you have a samurai spirit, this should feel like home.</desc>

    <title>Off the beaten track, Orlando</title>
    <desc>Out of the many adventures one can have in Orlando, I choose the off the beaten path things to do. My journey begins at the Orlando World Center Marriott, home to the biggest most amazing pool I’ve ever seen. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that mermaid classes are offered through the Mermaid Academy, poolside. The real adventure begins at the Paddling Center at Shingle Creek, which is a quick drive from the hotel. Lined with Cypress trees and the beautiful sounds of nature, it was the perfect setting for a relaxing kayak experience. I end my time in Orlando shopping at Artegon Marketplace. This is mall filled with local artisans who are passionate about their work and products. My highlight was being able to ride on a cute stuffed mechanical animal as I peruse the shops.</desc>

    <title>Tulum</title>
    <desc>At its core Tulum is a vibrant mix of extremely old and extremely new. Prehistoric natural wonders and ancient Mayan ruins are scattered among world-class resorts slinging more fresh lobster and mezcal than the human body is probably meant to consume. Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too. Do take advantage of that.</desc>

    <title>Top Ten Things to do in Puerto Rico</title>
    <desc>Number 10: Go for a hike in El Yunque National park – This is the only subtropical rainforest in the US (besides Hawaii) and is filled with so much bio diversity. Make sure you spot the ylang ylang tree to smell the beautiful flowers used in some of the best perfumes. http://ecotourspuertorico.com/el-yunque-tours-rainforest/ Number 9: Have lunch in La Placita at Chef Jose Enrique’s restaurant. Jose Enrique is an award winning chef who uses his master culinary skills to enrich traditional Puerto Rican dishes. http://www.joseenriquepr.com/ Number 8: Shop in el Mercado in La Placita – Be sure to stop by and talk to Hector Ruiz Housler, who sells herbs and concoctions used to treat all sorts of ailments. Number 7: Have a cafecito at Café Cuatro Sombras - Located in Old San Juan and has the richest, most authentic Puerto Rican coffee in town. http://cuatrosombras.com/ Number 6: Visit Casa Cortés - Indulge your senses in fine chocolate and fine art here. Try their chocolate and cheese snack and sample one of their delicious chocolate beverages. http://www.casacortespr.com/ Number 5: Go to Piñones for authentic Puerto Rican street food – Try the fresh oysters, clams and all of the delicious fried food offered here. Be sure to pass by the cultural center to learn the history of this important Puerto Rican neighborhood. Number 4: Spend an afternoon in the Botanical Gardens – Take a tour and smell the cinnamon and bay rum trees and if you’re lucky, you just might spot a coqui. http://sanjuanpuertorico.com/san-juan-botanical-garden-jardin-botanico-universidad-de-puerto-rico/ Number 3: Stay on Condado Beach. I love the San Juan Marriott Resort and Casino. It’s a quick drive from the airport, has breathtaking views, and has amazing service. http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sjupr-san-juan-marriott-resort-and-stellaris-casino/ Number 2: Have a Bioluminescence experience - Puerto Rico has three Bioluminescent bays which contain millions of micro-organisms, called “dinoflagellates”, that glow fluorescent in the dark when agi</desc>

    <title>Things to do in Al Quoz, Dubai’s art hub, home to Alserkal Avenue, artisan cafes and classic cars</title>
    <desc>Once just an overlooked industrial estate hidden behind the high-rises of Dubai’s Sheikh Zayed Road, Al Quoz is now the beating heart of the citys art scene. Home to Alserkal Avenue – actually a block of streets lined with some of the best art galleries in Dubai – Al Quoz is full of surprises.  There’s more than world-class art hidden behind Al Quozs vast landscape of warehouses; where theres art, theres life, after all – and life here is vibrant. Just about every enterprise in Al Quoz comes with an exciting twist; for example, Al Quoz restaurant and speciality coffee bar  Café Rider  doubles as a custom motorbike store. Mirzam , meanwhile, is an artisan chocolate factory thats also a café, located in the neighbourhood’s central art hub,  Alserkal Avenue . Alserkal Avenue cafes are defined by their fair-trade principles and creative concoctions that echo the area’s artistic character. From golden turmeric lattes to immune-boosting vegan matcha bowls, menus are bursting with goodness. Things to do in Alserkal Avenue and neighbouring complex, The Courtyard, include inspiring workshops; there are several to choose between. At  Oo La Lab , a fragrance mixology studio in Alserkal Avenue, you can learn how to create your own signature cologne. Or, just across the road, you can join an art class in Dubai’s popular community art space  thejamjar . Going strong for 15 years, thejamjar is a regular host of Alserkal Avenue events and art lessons, teaches budding artists of all ages several disciplines, from painting with oils to acrylic techniques.  Tilika D’Souza, an art instructor at thejamjar, says the wellbeing of the participants is also important to the foundation: "We have a workshop called  Intuitive Creativity  that combines meditation and art; we use all kinds of different art materials and we do a little meditation to begin with, so everybody is really relaxed during and after the class." For those who prefer to shop, tempting retail options include independent boutiques, such as  Chi-Ka , a</desc>

    <title>Marco Bettio</title>
    <desc>Owner and founder Marco Bettio speaks about his journey to success, and bringing a bit of "Italian Love" to Shanghai.Marco’s infectious personality immediately disarms you, it’s no wonder Goodfellas is one of the city’s best establishments to find authentic Italian comfort food. His passion for authenticity and obsession for comfort, pours out every minute you spend here. This place has a charming personality and we went directly to the source.Interview: MARCO BETTIOWhen I came here 10 years ago and started to do some consulting. I started to receive a lot of guests from all around the world..and I was always forced to bring them to fine dining places. I noticed that my clients weren’t really comfortable in the fine dining experience the first day they arrived in Shanghai.That’s what moved me to bring this real Italian dining experience to this area. I would say that we would always try to give a tailormade type of service. Greeting everybody, making them feel comfortable, it’s one of the most important things for us.Actually, “Goodfellas”..is meant to mean “good friends”..and this is the idea. There is no ego, there is no name of the chef, or my name on the door,..nothing but “Goodfellas.” It’s a place to for a good time with your friends, business partners, clients..to have an intimate experience in an enjoyable way.Chef Antonio is a great master, we actually call him “the maestro”,..it’s the italian way to address a very experienced chef. Since day one, Chef has been in charge of everything inside the kitchen...scouting the best ingredients and creating the recipes. Coming from big hotels, he initially wanted the kitchen to be very serious, less smiling, less interactive, etc..I never agreed with this, so we had to find a balance. And it took almost a year until we found that balance,...after he saw the happy customers and atmosphere we knew we were on to something and it because very harmonic. There is never an argument between the kitchen and the staff, and it’s amazing. This is a very big achievement..norma</desc>

    <title>Kanda</title>
    <desc>One way to think about Kanda is to picture early Brooklyn, before the hipsters completely took over. It’s a place that perfectly embodies old and new Tokyo, a university town that attracts more than students. It’s a great place to live (some even think it’s one of the best kept secrets of Tokyo) with just about everything you need in one place — restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and easy access to just about any other part of the city. While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other. With friendly and fiercely proud locals who want to share the area’s history, from origami to the Kanda Myojin Shrine, this is a quieter part of Tokyo just waiting to be discovered.</desc>

    <title>Duncan Lin</title>
    <desc>The Story of Duncan Lin“From my earliest memory, I have always liked drawing, but have never thought about making it my career,” says Duncan Lin, one of Taiwan’s most popular comics artists from Hualien. With a fanbase of 20 million and growing, Duncan has been approached by various renowned companies, such as Line, Asus, and TVBS for creative collaborations. He uses a caricature of himself as the main protagonist in his comics, which are centered around the hilarious going-ons of his daily life. With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc>

    <title>Taipei</title>
    <desc>Being underestimated, is one of the biggest advantages.  Maybe that’s what makes Taipei a unique city and one of Asia’s best kept secrets when it comes to food, fun, and all things lifestyle.  Often under-reported and overlooked, Taiwan’s global impact for such a small island is breathtaking. When it comes to Taiwan and food, experts and enthusiasts alike know that they go hand-in-hand.  It is no wonder Taipei is overflowing with electricity as new ideas and re-imagined classics are popping up all over town. This magical friction is a big reason Taipei’s food scene is attracting young talent from the world’s best kitchens looking to experiment, innovate, and test their ideas against the discerning palates of the local crowds.  Highlighted by some of the world’s best produce, great transportation, magnificent hiking trails 5 minutes from downtown, a vibrant nightlife, and an openness towards travelers and new faces makes Taipei one of Black Buddha’s favorite cities.</desc>

    <title>Dubai's coolest indoor attractions offer a break from the summer heat</title>
    <desc>Dubai is known for its year-round sunshine and blue skies but sometimes opting for an indoor attraction can offer a break from the heat. This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a  feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: "The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below  80 percent  in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals." Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: "It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve." iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc>

    <title>The Bankruptcy Boom &amp; The Golden Age of Fraud</title>
    <desc>2023 is going to finish up as the worst year for corporate bankruptcies since the end of the Global Financial Crisis. This year has also claimed the two biggest bankruptcies in American history that didn’t occur during the GFC and if that’s got you feeling nervous, don’t worry, according to the numbers 2024 is going to be much worse. According to data from Standard &amp; Poor’s, corporate bankruptcies in the major companies they track were up over 200 in the first half of 2023. High profile companies like wework, Vice Media and Bed Bath and Beyond all went under due to a combination of poor management, changing consumer preferences, high interest rates and bad market conditions. But what does this even mean? Even though these companies went bankrupt Vice is still making videos, you can still rent a office from WeWork, and Bed Bath and Beyond is still selling overpriced laundry hampers. Bankruptcies just aren’t what they used to be anymore and now instead of being the corporate equivalent of game over, it’s just another business strategy, which is just one of four reasons why it’s become so popular. Now you all know I hate videos from supposed experts with wide open mouths peddling some doomer, but the other three reasons why bankruptcies are on the rise are honestly worrying and they also show why business leaders just don’t take it seriously anymore. The first reason that bankruptcies are booming is because of a new investing strategy that rewards taking on as much risk as possible. Private equity is a broad classification of investing that just means putting money into companies that are not publicly listed on any securities exchange. Venture capitalists who invest in early startups are a type of private equity, all of the deals you watch get made on shark tank are private equity deals… if you give your family member a few thousand dollars to get their Etsy store going in exchange for a cut of their future profits you are technically a private equity investor, so make sure to slap that on your LinkedIn profile.

    <title>Dumb People are Earning More &amp; Hidden Billionaires</title>
    <desc>Dumb people make more money than smart people and it took a study conducted by really smart people to prove it. A study out of Sweden has found that top earners have lower intelligence than the people in income levels directly below them. The Plateauing of cognitive ability among top earners drew on data from 59,000 men who had to take a compulsory military conscription aptitude test. It then tracked their earnings over their professional careers to find the relationship between intelligence and income. Before Tai Lopez gets any ideas for more shitty YouTube commercials or the hustle bros learn how to read journal articles and use this to encourage people to drop out of college, I want you all to know how this data really works. The relationship between intelligence and income was strong, smarter people earnt more money but only up to six hundred and seventy thousand Swedish krona or sixty-four thousand dollars per year. After that intelligence didn’t mean much anymore and at the very top end of income earners, the 1, dumber people actually did better. So is this a sign that watching TikTok and reality TV is actually better for your career than going to college? Well maybe actually, for two important reasons but there are also two reasons why you should probably ignore this and keep studying hard if you want to get ahead financially. Reason number one why dumb people are doing better than smart people is that smart people fill in high prestige jobs that don’t have high salaries. Academics and research scientists are some of the smartest people in the world, but they don’t get paid well. Doctors, lawyers and elite financiers also need to be very smart to get through demanding schooling and admission exams and these professionals ARE typically compensated very competitively BUT most of them don’t make it all the way into the 1. In the USA to be in the top 1 of income earners an individual needs to make at least five hundred and ninety-seven thousand dollars before tax and that’s just the minimum to join the 1 c</desc>

    <title>INVISIBLE YOUNG</title>
    <desc>Over a four-year period, Rachel lived on the streets of Seattle, saw close friends die, and she was herself beaten on several occasions. Michael was five years old when he was placed in foster care. Over the next 11 years, Michael would see over 70 different placements. Several times he ran away - life on the streets was more to his liking. Jacklyn grew up with a mother who was a perfect candidate for the TV show Hoarders. Jacklyn describes her father as a violent, abusive, alcoholic drug addict. So at 13 when a friend took her to meet some homeless kids living under a bridge in town, Jacklyn knew she had found a new life. She would spend the next eight years on the streets. Jackson had a more traditional home life. But early exposure to drugs in his teen years resulted in Jackson choosing homelessness upon graduating high school. After several years hopping trains and living on the streets, a near brush with death forced him to reassess his situation.</desc>

    <title>TRING TRING</title>
    <desc>The days are getting busier at the hotel and the constant running around and hauling plates etc is getting to Sundar. He just wishes he could quickly finish up and snooze the rest of the time. After an especially hectic day of waiting/cleaning, Sundar cant believe his luck when he finds an old busted cycle near the backyard of the Hotel. With a little tinkering (taking parts out), Sundar manages to change it into a unicycle that will help him clean up and wait tables faster. What Sundar doesnt expect is that balancing on a unicycle can be quite a tricky issue  he botches up the deliveries badly and Chai Raja orders him to get rid of the unicycle. Sundar does so with a heavy heart but imagine his surprise when the next day morning he wakes up to a familiar bell- its the unicycleits back and Basha is on it. What hurts more is that Chai Raja is encouraging it as Basha on the unicycle is helping amp up the customer flow. Sundar wants his unicycle back not only because he believes it should him getting the applause but also because the nifty Basha is using the unicycle performance as a faade to stealing fritters. Sundar and Basha have a showdown and Sundar getting carried away, performs with such a frenzy that ultimately he crashes the pantry down. The final shot is off Sundar cleaning up the mess wearing the cycle tire as a reluctant garland.</desc>

    <title>RAIN IN KELIFORNIA</title>
    <desc>It is monsoon time and the teashop is leaking at various places. The customers are irritated with rain drops trickling on their head, clothes and even into their tea tumblers. And they start leaving the shop. A tensed Chai Raja orders Sundar to put a sheet over the roof. Sundar obediently and effectively does it and comes back. But Basha seizes the opportunity and wants to have some fun. It is leak marathon in the teashop with a group of suffering customers, angry Chai Raja and a panic stricken Sundar. At last when the entire roof flies off and it is literally monsoon inside the teashop, Basha stylishly comes outside the shop holding a giant umbrella. And all the customers run under it and have their steaming teas and snacks. An angry Chai Raja whacks Sundar and ask him to learn something from the smart Basha!</desc>

    <title>APPRENTICE ALERT</title>
    <desc>Chai Raja is in his inventive mood and rigging up a new treat for his customers. In streak Basha chased by Sundar and the two mess around the kitchen while Chai Raja has stepped out for a second. As he tosses stuff to keep Sundar at bay, Basha accidentally makes a couple of special jalebis. Chai Raja steps back in and the two freeze mid-motion. Chai Raja scoops out the simmering jalebis and sniffs, his nose wrinkling. Sundar eagerly points at Basha sure that the monkey is sure to get in trouble this time, but much to his chagrin, Basha is hired- as an apprentice!! As Sundar glumly waits at the tables, Basha (the show-off) not only builds an acrobatic rapport with Chai Raja and makes life miserable for Sundar, but also manages to gobble up fries on the sly. Sundar has to find some means of getting Basha fired and tries to sneak in and mess with Bashas batter. But he ends up only making it better and earning Basha more pats on his back. The MP arrives and Chai Raja wants to show off his new apprentices skills  Basha is in the spotlight and sure to crack under the heat. Sundar, meanwhile ready to be rid of Basha in any manner possible, sticks dynamite in the batter. Basha, stumped as to what to cook , hastily shapes up the batter into an inviting cake. Seeing a wick, the MP lights it- and slices...KABOOM! Both Basha and Sundar, trod with heavy shoulders out the tea stall as a charred Chai Raja signals they are fired.</desc>

But things go for a toss when the wrestlers arch-rival comes in and expects to be served by Sundar. A hapless Sundar is torn between the two angry fat men. And to add to the misery is our super mischievous Basha who is making sure that Sundar messes up everything with the wrestlers. The chain of events reach a point where the wrestlers start a kushti fight inside the hotel and BashamakES sure that Sundar becomes their punching bag. Will Sundars luck save him?!!!</desc>

    <title>POT BOILER</title>
    <desc>Chai Rajas normal kettle is sent in for repair and Chai Raja, very hesitantly brings out the antique kettle that is his inheritance from his great granddad. With extreme care and caution (and reverence), he sets about making tea, but then there is a sudden visit by the politician who demands that Chai Raja sit with him to discuss about tea provision for the upcoming elections. Chai Raja cant refuse and Sundar has to take on the task of tea making while Chai Raja sits with the politician. Sundar, knowing Chai Rajas affections for the special kettle handles it with kid gloves but he doesnt anticipate Basha poking his tail in and thats when mayhem ensues. As Chai Raja glares intermittently from afar, Sundar desperately tries to keep the pot boiling without melting it up altogether. He is however distracted by the customers who dont much seem to like the taste of tea being served that day. Basha takes advantage of Sundars distraction and flicks the kettle. Sundar desperately tries to get it back. He lunges and manages to yank Basha by his tail, but this only sends the ancient kettle flying. Later we see Chai Raja tearfully hang up a new wind-chime (made of pieces of his antique kettle) and then glare at Sundar who has been assigned a tower of dishes to wash. Basha sniggers in the distance, blowing into the spout of the kettle, whistling the chai chaitune!</desc>

    <title>What Goes Up</title>
    <desc>Mayor De Pfeffle is hosting a party for all of Abra-Dabra and is granting Deedee the honour of inviting everyone to assemble at 12 o’clock sharp. But with Tiggy having prepared all the delectable dishes and only one hour to get them to the venue and Deedee rushing to invite everybody; Deedee decides to use some magic for the timebeing. On sprinkling some of her ‘light as air’ magic powder on the plates and Nino stringing them together as the master knots-man he is, Tiggy is able to walk them over to town-hall like a bunch of balloons. Deedee and Nino get to invite Charlie and the twins just when Boris misfires his new fishing dart gun onto Uncle Charlie causing him to fall out of his hammock. The Doobydoos and Mewmew are playing together by trying to find which group can make the tallest team-tower, just when Deedee and Nino invites them for the party. Back at town-hall Mayor De Pfeffle and Tiggy create a floating food game, but Tiggy reminds the Mayor that he isn’t good at tying knots. When the guests arrive, Mayor De Pfeffle and Tiggy usher them in and tell them how to play the game, but discover that all the strings have loosened themselves and are floating high up near the ceiling. Deedee improvises and gets the twins to use their toy dart guns to pull the food-laden plates to themselves. The Doobydoos along with Mewmew make really tall team-towers and pull their jelly plates to themselves with glee. Nino pulls down a plate that happens to be a bowl of custard. Nino gets drenched in custard, but in a very delicious way.</desc>

    <title>Wheres Nino?</title>
    <desc>Nino is trying to have a non-magic game time with Deedee, but she wants just the opposite. So she conjures a invisi-ball game. But the spell bounces off the ball and makes Nino invisible instead. Deedee is sad her spell went cuckoo on Nino, but Nino can’t stand her magic any more, so she checks out a remedy in her magic book and finds that the spell would cancel itself with three chimes of the town hall bell. Deedee decides to get Nino to the spot at the earliest. Nino scares the Doobydoos in his new ‘form’, but soon gets them to play along as he removes his helmet and is completely invisible now. Nino loves the fact that he is invisible and plays tricks on sleepy Charlie. Deedee sees the Doobydoos playing with the helmet and think they are throwing Nino about. But when she realizes that Nino isn’t in it, she is even more worried as the spell can become permanent if it isn’t cancelled soon. Nino has lots of fun playing pranks on Tiggy, Deedee, Charlie and Mewmew. Nino soon realizes that his pranks have gone out of hand that Mayor De Pfeffle announces over the loudspeaker to get Nino to come to them. Nino appears and is stubborn to stay invisible, so Deedee catches Nino with her hat and gets him in place to take full effect of the town hall chimes. Having regained his visibility, Nino agrees that a little magic is fun.</desc>

Chai Raja is super-excited to have VIP guest. To serve his the best of his tea, Chai Raja opens a special shelf and takes out a very specially protected rack. It is a small herbarium filled with the most exoctic tea saplings...sure to make Chai Rajas brews that much more irresistible. Sundar is assigned the responsibility of taking care of the saplings...but Basha has to stick his monkey-snout into the affairs so that Sundar would be too caught up trying to keep the exotic saplings safe from harm and would be distracted from the snack shelf which is Bashastarget.. Now Basha has two distractions to mess with and make Sundars life more miserable. Sundar stumbles, fumbles and lurches through service till his clashes with Basha ends in Sundar landing the herbarium on the VIP guest. Everything in the shop reaches the VIP guest, except for the tea. He is beaten, bruised and infuriated. And when he couldnt take it anymore and he is about to get out, poor Sundar somehow gets the tea to him. Raged beyond words, he sips the special tea.. It is heaven!!! He loves itttt. He thanks Chai Raja, and leaves the teashop a happy man (yet bruised and limping). Sundar is ecstatic. And Basha is flummoxed!</desc>

    <title>Charlie’s Castle</title>
    <desc>It’s Uncle Charlie’s birthday and the twins have surprised him with a nap mask and breakfast, but the twins want to celebrate a little more by throwing a party and inviting all their friends. Although Charlie wishes to have a more peaceful celebration, he gives in to the pleas of Boris and Sandy. After getting a hint from Charlie on how much he loves chess, boris and sandy plan the birthday party around a ‘knights and castles’ theme. The twins get Deedee to bring balloons, a castle cake with turrets from Tiggy and a jousting dance from Mewmew. Boris and Sandy set out to decorate Uncle Charlie’s house, just in time for their friends coming in with all the goodies for the party. They even invent a balloon jousting game between Deedee and Mewmew that makes Mewmew crash into Tiggy’s cake and thereby wreck all the arrangements much to the dismay of the twins. This calls for Deedee’s magic where all the party ingredients are put into a large purple cauldron and it makes a gigantic bouncing castle in the chequerboard garden. And the snoring sounds lead them to find Uncle Charlie napping right inside it. They bounce around Uncle Charlie as much as they can and then wind down for a long snooze. Uncle Charlie awakes to happily find that the twins have organised his most best birthday slumber party ever.</desc>
