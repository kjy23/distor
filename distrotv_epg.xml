    <title>NEW League of Legends Champion Renata Glasc ABILITIES REVEALED</title>
    <desc>Even though she looks like she was ripped straight out of Arcane, technically, Renata Glasc, the Chem Baroness, wasn’t. She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc>

    <title>Balloon trip gives passengers a real bird’s eye view of the desert</title>
    <desc>Ballooning is the earliest form of human flight. In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep -  took off in one  from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring.  “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.”  Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of  Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.”  Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc>

    <title>What to do in Pompano Beach</title>
    <desc>One of South Florida’s hidden gems is Pompano Beach, Florida. Located just north of Fort Lauderdale, this quiet beach town is perfect for those who prefer less crowds and a laid back atmosphere. It’s ideal location makes access to other South Florida towns, including Miami, super easy. I start my journey at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Pompano Beach Resort &amp; Spa. It has the most amazing sunrises which I delighted in each day from my private balcony. The hotel is located directly on the beach which makes it very difficult to leave. I visit the charming beachside town of Lauderdale by the Sea, a 10 minute drive from my hotel. I also take a tour at Butterfly World, the first and largest butterfly house in the United States. It is home over 80 species of butterflies, hummingbird and lorikeet aviaries, and outdoor gardens. This place is truly magical for people of all ages. Pompano Beach is the quintessential beach town. You can truly relax and enjoy the beach at your own pace while indulging as much or as little as you’d like.</desc>

    <title>Did you know Dubai is fifth most instagrammed city in the world?</title>
    <desc>Dubai has been named the 5th most Instagrammed city in the world in a survey by travel site Wego. From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational," she explains. "It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So, you’re looking for something that is bright, that real</desc>

    <title>Taste Dubai: An Emirati Iftar</title>
    <desc>During Ramadan, practising Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours. The meal that follows is known as Iftar, and you do not have to be Muslim to partake in one. In this edition of Taste, Euronews visited the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Hotel in Dubai, to sample the special Iftar menu produced by the worlds first Emirati chef. After Athan, the call for evening prayer, Muslims who have been fasting all day can finally eat and drink. The fast is broken by first eating dates. This is of great religious significance, chef Musabbeh Al Kaabi explained. "Prophet Mohammed used to do this when he was breaking his fast, so we always break it with the dates then laban (a fermented milk drink) or water," he said. Chef Musabbeh first served up a traditional dish - king rice. Its name comes from its historically prestigious status as an expensive dish only eaten by royalty or the rich. "Liver is there, beef is there, saffron rice is there. So it’s all luxury things. I have cooked saffron rice, I have fried cauliflower, boiled chickpeas. Now I need to take the flavour of the onions with all these things," Chef Musabbeh said as he prepared the dish. "I will put the rice in now. I’ll put some spices in as well. So now, I’m going to put it on a plate, and I’m going to garnish it" But, before eating, everyone said Bismillā, which means in the name of Allah. Chef Musabbeh then prepared his second dish the famous Emirati ouzi with oriental rice, a lamb dish with cinnamon and cardamom. You can make the dish yourself by following the recipe below: Chef Musabbehs Ouzi and Oriental Rice Recipe Ingredients: 1100g lamb shank 500g of basmati rice 100g of minced lamb 2 bay leaves 3 cinnamon sticks 10g of garlic - freshly chopped 120g of onion - freshly chopped 100g of tomato - freshly chopped 20g of ghee butter Salt and pepper 6.5ml of water 10g of tamarind powder 40g of Emirati spices 30g of tomato paste 40g of coriander - freshly chopped Instructions: 1.

    <title>Panoramic Paramotoring</title>
    <desc>It consists of a tricycle, an engine powering a propeller that fills a canopy and - thankfully- a back-up canopy.  One of the smallest aircraft in the world, Paramotors are the latest way to take to the skies above Dubais sand dunes.  And as its wing rises, so does Euronews James OHagans nerves: "My pilot Jos assures me he’s never needed it ( the backup wing)." The morning mist clears and Jos Vandenbroucke, General manager pf Paramotor Desert Adventure, has given the word to go ahead. "Ready for rock and roll? he says. "We’re like 40/50 metres. No more. We can easily go up to 12,000 feet. In case we have an engine failure, it’s just doing this (Jos turns off engine)." Paramotors are one of the smallest aircraft in the world and have a great safety record because the engine is only needed for gaining altitude and can be switched off when you come back down to land. "We will do a spiral. If you can’t hold it anymore James, you just shout." "Now we do a 360 to the right. Yalla, here we go!" "The G-force in your stomach is class!" says OHagan. Flying over a stretch of desert reserve, you can see an array of wildlife; families of camels, Arabian oryx and even a tower of giraffes. "After that, I think I can safely say that I’ve got over my fear of flying and kiss the ground," says OHagan.</desc>

    <title>Things to do in Al Quoz, Dubai’s art hub, home to Alserkal Avenue, artisan cafes and classic cars</title>
    <desc>Once just an overlooked industrial estate hidden behind the high-rises of Dubai’s Sheikh Zayed Road, Al Quoz is now the beating heart of the citys art scene. Home to Alserkal Avenue – actually a block of streets lined with some of the best art galleries in Dubai – Al Quoz is full of surprises.  There’s more than world-class art hidden behind Al Quozs vast landscape of warehouses; where theres art, theres life, after all – and life here is vibrant. Just about every enterprise in Al Quoz comes with an exciting twist; for example, Al Quoz restaurant and speciality coffee bar  Café Rider  doubles as a custom motorbike store. Mirzam , meanwhile, is an artisan chocolate factory thats also a café, located in the neighbourhood’s central art hub,  Alserkal Avenue . Alserkal Avenue cafes are defined by their fair-trade principles and creative concoctions that echo the area’s artistic character. From golden turmeric lattes to immune-boosting vegan matcha bowls, menus are bursting with goodness. Things to do in Alserkal Avenue and neighbouring complex, The Courtyard, include inspiring workshops; there are several to choose between. At  Oo La Lab , a fragrance mixology studio in Alserkal Avenue, you can learn how to create your own signature cologne. Or, just across the road, you can join an art class in Dubai’s popular community art space  thejamjar . Going strong for 15 years, thejamjar is a regular host of Alserkal Avenue events and art lessons, teaches budding artists of all ages several disciplines, from painting with oils to acrylic techniques.  Tilika D’Souza, an art instructor at thejamjar, says the wellbeing of the participants is also important to the foundation: "We have a workshop called  Intuitive Creativity  that combines meditation and art; we use all kinds of different art materials and we do a little meditation to begin with, so everybody is really relaxed during and after the class." For those who prefer to shop, tempting retail options include independent boutiques, such as  Chi-Ka , a</desc>

    <title>Mrs. Pound</title>
    <desc>Dont judge a book by its cover, this is not your average stamp shop. Inspired by a fictional story of secret lovers, Mrs. Pound brings to life the story of a former 1950s Shanghai burlesque dancer, her married lover (Mr. Ming) and their elaborate clandestine rendezvous space. Offering a new twist on asian fusion cuisine, the 45 seat venue features a lower dining room (Mrs. Pound), an upper dining room (Mr . Ming), and a bar area at which these two spaces merge. Mixed with plush velvet banquettes, vintage tiles, neon artwork, suspended mirrored marquee lights with lipstick messages, and a 1960s style showgirl glamour, Mrs. Pounds creative interior sets the tone for a unique and entertaining culinary (and drinking) experience.

    <title>Keeping tradition alive in Dubai</title>
    <desc>Tradition isnt exactly what first comes to mind when one thinks of Dubai, a city that quite literally grew out of the desert, but tourists are flocking to the Middle Eastern oasis for a taste of its Bedouin past.  Camel races Old meets new can be seen at  Dubais Camel Racing Club  where these ships of the desert sprint across the perimeter of the famed Al Mamoom racetrack.  Attracting both camel owners and punters alike, spectators can sit in their cars and drive alongside the camels as they hurtle towards the finish line, guided by a remote control jockey.  Organisers say the event is a draw for tourists for a number of reasons.  “When tourists come to the camel racing venues, they see something new. They see how people treat the camels and how the camels compete with each other. They also see how Emirati society promotes camels,  says the clubs CEO and General Amanager Ali Saeed Bin Saroud.  Camel racing was promoted by the former UAE president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as a way of bringing camels and back into mainstream Dubai culture.  The Dubai Royal Family also actively support camel racing as a way of preserving the traditional Bedouin culture.  Desert culture The  Al Marmoom Heritage Festival  is Dubai’s annual celebration of the traditional Arabian desert culture and vital role which it plays in the cultural identity of its people.  Traditional markets, music and dancing are another way in which the Bedouin culture is kept alive and enjoyed by Dubai locals and tourists alike.  Arabic hospitality German expat Ursula Musch moved to Dubai around 20 years ago after first visiting in 1993.  She now breeds camels and encourages tourists to experience the Bedouin customs for themselves, as they, like her, may just find their passion in life.  My passion or my message is I want to give foreigners, other people the chance to know something from the Arabic hospitality, from their tradition, from their culture, to show it to give it to other people who don’t</desc>

    <title>Sak Yant Tattoo</title>
    <desc>Traditional hand needle tattoos have been a staple of Thai culture for centuries with the common practitioners being Buddhist monks. Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc>

    <title>From screen to plate: the MasterChef restaurant goes live</title>
    <desc>Its the most successful cookery television format in the world having been adapted in 52 countries and viewed by over 250 million people worldwide. Now the  MasterChef TV Experience  is going from screen to plate with a new restaurant in Dubai. Its a world first, and Euronews Jane Witherspoon went to check it out. Shaun O’Neale was champion of MasterChef US Season 7 . He says the contest was one of the most stressful and hardest things hes ever done. "Youve got  Gordon Ramsay  screaming down your throat if youre not doing something right. But, it was the most rewarding thing, the most fulfilling thing. It really showed me my true passion and my true love for food. So its about time for people to come in and experience and get a taste of that mystery box." Now Sean and other  MasterChef champions  will be in residency at the MasterChef TV Experience - where they will also compose their own  personal menus. Running the show In charge of the kitchen, the restaurants Head Chef, Margarita Vaamonde-Beggs. She says the MasterChef brand is a perfect fit for a restaurant - and for Dubai. "I believe that we stand out for us because we have already a huge fan base. In the Dubai market, it’s a city of foodies and it means something to so many people around the world." The Mystery Box One highlight on the menu is based on the shows Mystery Box challenge. Guests choose secret ingredients from the box and chefs have 35 minutes to create an original dish. And thats the dish Euronews wants. Today the Mystery Box ingredients include black garlic, Jerusalem artichokes, fresh oregano and a variety of mushrooms. They look delicious but will barely more than half-an-hour be enough time to turn them into a meal? Chef Margarita isnt worried: "We are going to be on time. Its going to be fine." It gets down to wire but 35 minutes later, with not a second to spare, Chef Margarita has produced a mouth-watering stuffed raviolo, covered with chocolate and black garlic. Not only does it taste amazing,</desc>

    <title>La Mer, Dubai’s newest beachfront neighbourhood, offers hip restaurants, water sports and fun parks</title>
    <desc>With the construction of Dubai’s latest luxury residential development,  Port de La Mer by Meraas , and new hotel,  Rove La Mer , La Mer is a of rising interest in today’s property market. La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club,  Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include  Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is  iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free. La Mer’s shops focus on beach pursuits and accessories, making it a good place to shop for swimwear, sunglasses, suntan lotion</desc>

    <title>Duncan Lin</title>
    <desc>The Story of Duncan Lin“From my earliest memory, I have always liked drawing, but have never thought about making it my career,” says Duncan Lin, one of Taiwan’s most popular comics artists from Hualien. With a fanbase of 20 million and growing, Duncan has been approached by various renowned companies, such as Line, Asus, and TVBS for creative collaborations. He uses a caricature of himself as the main protagonist in his comics, which are centered around the hilarious going-ons of his daily life. With the cameras rolling, he wears his character as a mask, not wishing to expose his face. He is about 5’3, with a skinny frame, his dyed blonde hair peeking out from behind his mask. “My father always objected to my interest in drawing, but my mother was rather supportive. Some of my most precious memories are of those childhood drawings. I would show them to my mother, deeply excited, and she would look at them and say, ‘Oh, that’s [a] really nice picture’, and then display it on the fridge using a magnet. And I would feel so proud every time she did this. I would think, ‘Wow, I need to draw more, because I want more things to be displayed on the fridge’, and then slowly…. the fridge got filled up. And the old drawings would be removed, and the whole process would be repeated. And this small matter, and that fridge, they influenced me, and allowed me to feel like perhaps I should continue drawing in the future.”On the other hand, Duncan’s father was a strict figure, quite the opposite of his mother. “My father never smiled at me from the day I was born till the day he passed away. He never genuinely smiled at me and was always kind of distant - he’s a very, very strict kind of father - so we never really talked much, and of course after I graduated from high school, I left home.” Like all typical Asian parents, Duncan’s father hammered the notion: ‘do not pursue art because you’ll starve to death’, and that if he became an artist, ‘you’ll only earn money after you’re dead’.During his university years, Duncan majored i</desc>

    <title>Duck de Chine</title>
    <desc>When you think Beijing, you think ancient history, bustling metropolis and duck. There arent many meals that can claim royal lineage dating back almost a thousand years to the ancient emperors of China. Known as Peking Duck, Beijing Duck or Chinese Roast Duck , this dish is a signature staple of the city and you could spend weeks soul searching and taste testing your way through a variety of recipes (yes, even KFC has one).  To save you time, Duck de Chine is one of the annual contenders for the best roast duck in the land and offers an extravagant dining experience. An impressive and inviting décor, complete with vermillion fabrics, dazzling chandeliers, cozy brick walls and large round tables, offers a luxury setting to indulge in the local specialty. Whether you enjoy sugar or spice, a variety of delicious sides accompany the glistening moist meat of this whole duck, prepared over the open flames of 60 year old Jujube wood. Pro tip: dip the crispy skin directly in the raw sugar and enjoy the ride. Smaller dishes, a separate dim sum menu and a full champagne bar are also available so set aside plenty of time to plant yourself in this beautiful dining room and feast away like its 1330.</desc>

    <title>Discover the supersized attractions of Downtown Dubai, starting with the world’s tallest building</title>
    <desc>Downtown Dubai’s ample attractions include a 10-million litre aquarium, an Olympic-sized ice rink and the world’s tallest building. Nothing can prepare visitors for the true scale of record-breaking  Burj Khalifa . At twice the height of the Empire State Building and almost three times the size of the Eiffel Tower, it soars 828 metres into the sky. Inside, there are 160 floors occupied by designer Giorgio Armani’s first-ever  hotel , award-winning restaurants, luxury apartments and offices – and observation decks at levels 124, 125 and 148.  Colourful wings, painted on observation deck windows, are designed for guests to pose between them. Part of the Global Angel Wings Project by Colette Miller, before appearing in Dubai, they were seen in Australia, China, Cuba, Europe, Kenya, Japan and the United States. The wings hint that humans can be angels of the earth and serve as a reminder to do good. Next door,  The Dubai Mall  houses more of Downtown Dubai’s supersized attractions. Visitors can cage-dive with sharks at the vast  Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo  and Dubai Mall’s indoor  ice rink  is an ample fit for professional figure skaters at 60 metres long; it can also snow here at the flick of a switch. While some attractions defy reality, others escape it altogether. Dubbed ‘The Centre of Now’, Downtown Dubai can take visitors to the future at the world’s largest  VR Park  in The Dubai Mall, a hive of virtual and augmented realities. Dubai in 2050 is the setting of indoor park’s augmented reality rollercoaster, made all the more exhilarating with headsets that place passengers in the cockpit of a computer-generated helicopter. As the virtual helicopter orbits out of the control, the very real, very fast rollercoaster cars plummet through loops and spin on their axes.   Bustling with entertainment, Downtown Dubai’s high-octane epicentre is looped by the laidback, café-lined Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Boulevard – a starting point for a public art trail. Downtown Dubai is an urban canvas of sculptures</desc>

    <title>Jilsiru Tteok Cafe</title>
    <desc>At first blush, the Jilsiru Tteok Cafe may strike more adventurous explorers as a bit of a snoozefest. Its a cafe attached to an actual Tteok museum (koreans take their rice cakes seriously) inside the old, traditional Insadong neighborhood. Nothing new or trendy but its actually one of those places that you may find yourself wandering back into after your initial bad attitude. The first floor houses the Tteok Cafe where one can essentially purchase and eat every variety of Tteok known to mankind pretty much. The textures and fillings are as varied as the many colors that are on display and its easy to mindlessly go into a tteok-frenzy but it pays to be selective because theres only so much glutinous rice hunks one can eat in one sitting and tteok is known to go stale quickly.When youve had your fill of colorful starch, head up to the 2nd floor where you can find the museum part of the experience and learn about the thousands of years of tteok history. And if youre wanting a little more action after, head on over to the traditional Korean Liquor Museum which is in the same building.In total, this place really is a hub for Koreas days of yore, including spreads on North Korean cuisine and what emperors have been served . Just make sure you come brave enough to try the dried manta ray.</desc>

    <title>Tulum</title>
    <desc>At its core Tulum is a vibrant mix of extremely old and extremely new. Prehistoric natural wonders and ancient Mayan ruins are scattered among world-class resorts slinging more fresh lobster and mezcal than the human body is probably meant to consume. Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too. Do take advantage of that.</desc>

    <title>Taipei</title>
    <desc>Being underestimated, is one of the biggest advantages.  Maybe that’s what makes Taipei a unique city and one of Asia’s best kept secrets when it comes to food, fun, and all things lifestyle.  Often under-reported and overlooked, Taiwan’s global impact for such a small island is breathtaking. When it comes to Taiwan and food, experts and enthusiasts alike know that they go hand-in-hand.  It is no wonder Taipei is overflowing with electricity as new ideas and re-imagined classics are popping up all over town. This magical friction is a big reason Taipei’s food scene is attracting young talent from the world’s best kitchens looking to experiment, innovate, and test their ideas against the discerning palates of the local crowds.  Highlighted by some of the world’s best produce, great transportation, magnificent hiking trails 5 minutes from downtown, a vibrant nightlife, and an openness towards travelers and new faces makes Taipei one of Black Buddha’s favorite cities.</desc>

    <title>Dubai acts to stem the tide of single use plastic</title>
    <desc>Dubai’s airports have banned all single use plastics as the city works towards a plastic-free future.   It comes as the attitude towards single use plastics is changing. In Dubai, 90 per cent of people say they are making a conscious effort to reduce their own plastic waste consumption. Nearly four in five say they recycle more now than they did five years ago. And one in four people say theyre encouraged to recycle more by corporations championing plastic-free initiatives. Dubai International Airport along with Dubai World Central welcome almost 90 million passengers each year. But with those passengers comes 5,500 tonnes of plastic. The airports’ operator, Dubai Airports, banned all single use plastics from inside the terminal at the beginning of this year. That means that plastic cutlery, water bottles, drinking straws, packaging and polythene bags are all banned from cafes and restaurants. Eugene Barry, Dubai Airports’ executive vice president (commercial), told Focus: “Ninety five per cent of our partners have actually made the pledge to switch from plastic to appropriate and relevant substitutes for some of the products that are used in catering and retail across the airport.” The operator hopes its a strategy that might become a template for other major transportation hubs and businesses. “This is very much the early stages of a long journey, I believe, to have a more environmentally friendly approach to managing businesses,” Barry said. Dubai’s 700 hotels are already looking at alternatives, such as switching water bottles from plastic to glass. Plastic key cards could also be a thing of the past, as developers look into switching them to wood-based materials. The eco packaging company Avani is one firm offering plastic-free alternatives, including a bag made from cassava, a cheap and common root vegetable. The material is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea. Peter Avram, managing director of Avani Middle East, said: “Until a c</desc>

    <title>How Venture Capital Works &amp; Blackstone vs Blackrock</title>
    <desc>Venture capital is a two hundred- and fifty-billion-dollar industry that takes your money whether you know it or not and puts it into promising start-ups like, FTX, Theranos, and WeWork but what do these people actually do all day and how are they different from private equity or hedge funds? Venture capital is a type of private equity and private equity is any investment made into a non-public company or security. A private equity fund raises money from investors to buy companies or other assets that are not listed on public exchanges and use them to generate returns. Private companies are much less transparent then public companies which are forced by the SEC and the exchanges to publish financials every quarter in addition to other information that they must keep current. Private companies are also harder to buy or sell since you can’t just open your Robinhood app and buy some shares. The difficulty and illiquidity of dealing with private companies means that investors expect higher returns and the managers running the funds can charge higher fees to compensate them for the extra work. They achieve those high returns through a number of different strategies, one strategy is a buyout fund that will take investor money, take out a large loan on top of that money and use it to buy a large established company that can be made more efficient by laying off staff and improving processes. Another private equity strategy is the rescue fund that buys a failing business for cheap and tries to turn it around, usually by laying off staff and improving processes. But if you don’t have the stomach for firing people all day then Venture Capital is the type of private equity for you. Most of the private equity industry works with established private companies but venture capital invest into businesses that are just getting started. Some private equity investments will be made into businesses that are nothing more than some ideas drawn on a napkin. But what does that actually involve doing? You wake up one day and find out you</desc>

    <title>DAMSEL DISTRESS</title>
    <desc>Sundar is dusting the shop in the morning just before service when out of a wallet falls an old photo of a pretty girl. Grinning, Sundar shoves it in front of Chai Raja. Chai Raja taken aback at the photo sighs and looks lovelorn for a second- then shoves the wallet and photo out of sight. Sundar is distracted by another of naughty Bashas antics and doesnt think much of it until there is a swish of unusual colour at the door entrance. And there she stands! Chai Rajas old army crush! Chai Raja is at first stunned but surprise turns to shock when she holds out an invitation- for her newly opening snack shop, right next door. Chai Raja starts sweating and Sundar understands the cause for her consternation soon enough when the next day Chaha Devi (what she calls herself) opens her stand. Its a runaway hit! She is a Bharatnatyam dancer and cooks a meaner batch of fries than Chai Raja dancing bharatnatyam while she cooks  so good that not only Chai Rajas clientele is wooed away, but so is Basha! There starts a hilarious and amusing dance off between Chai Raja and Chaha Devi. Chai raja is torn between anger and admiration and its all left to Sundar to salvage Hotel Californias future..and for that may need Bashas help!</desc>

    <title>Breaking Chai</title>
    <desc>A holy man with quite a fan following claiming to possess magical telepathic powers turns up outside the shop. Chai Raja is more than accommodating- after all its extra business right at the doorstep and Basha is curious as the flexible Baba flaunts some acrobatic twists that Basha finds interesting. Sundar, on the other hand is too lazy and not enthusiastic about the extra crowd. The Baba is pompous and demanding- he bosses Chai Raja about . Chai Raja sees the crowding eager fans and the extra money and accommodates the demands. But Sundar is irritated by the Babas attitude and would love to get rid of him. Basha on the flipside is won over by the Baba who magically pulls out special bananas for Basha- Basha instantly teams up with the Baba. Sundar annoyed further at this partnership clumsily intervenes and instead he ends up exposing the Baba who was actually an imposter all along. Though the show is ruined, Chai Raja still grins as his shop has suddenly gone all popular and people are streaming in to see the dog that dunnit and Sundar for once, though still a server, beams as he dishes out paw-shaped fritters- his way of giving an autograph.</desc>

    <title>Runaway Custard</title>
    <desc>Tiggy is busy making custard and Deedee and Nino are helping out. But Mayor De Pfeffle cannot seem to understand what happened to his purple custard freshly sent over by Nino. So Mewmew offers to help while taking eggs over to Tiggy’s. But the carton turns out to only have one egg, and Tiggy needs to make eight more jars of purple custard. The answer seems to lie in Deedee’s magic spell that makes one purple custard jar never run out of purple custard for the entire day. And it works like a charm, non-stop purple custard. The Mayor gets a half eaten jar of purple custard and keeps it safe for after, only to have it finished by the Doobydoos. As the Mayor turns up at Tiggy’s once more for more purple custard, he rushes off with the jar that the spell has been cast on. A happy Mayor gets Mewmew to stay guard of the jar while he is out, and Mewmew catches the Doobydoos red handed trying to eat the custard. But the jar tips over in the confusion and unknown to Mewmew the loyal custard guard, the bottle keeps on flowing till it reaches the ground floor. Deedee is called in urgency and only Nino can fly up the building and put the jar right up again. Having done that they call all the townsfolk to come to town hall to eat up as much purple custard as they can. All join in and have a hearty treat, so much so that they cannot have a bite more. Finally Mayor De Pfeffle arrives and is happy to share his purple custard with everyone, but much to his surprise no one wants any. Wonder why?</desc>

    <title>DOGGONE DAY</title>
    <desc>Things are normal at Hotel California- and just as crazy- as Chai Raja serves up teas and Sundar tries to keep the frisky Basha at bay. But then turns up a hulk of a man who is brusque and curt- yet Chai Raja is impressed as he seems to be ex-military. However, Sundars accidentally trips on the mans kit which is burstingwith dog-catching equipment. Freaking out, Sundar tries all zany disguises so that the dogcatcher doesnt figure out that he is in fact a dog- which would have probably worked....if not for dependably wily Basha. The monkey repeatedly botches up Sundars attempts as Chai Raja scratches his head trying to figure out when he had hired such a plethora of ill-dressed waiters and where in chais name, was Sundar?! The dog catcher ultimately sniffs out Sundars existence and eagerly tries to nab him. In an unusual show of affection, Chai Raja refuses to hand over Sundar. But the dog catcher is stubborn and lurks around laying traps. Basha helps by purposely leading Sundar toward the traps. It would have been his last day at the shop for Sundar, but for Basha accidentally setting off a trap too early and the dogcatcher getting caught in one of his own traps. As the medics haul him off and Basha pouts, Sundar chuckles and starts swabbing the floor with gusto.</desc>

After a particularly hectic service, Sundar believes he has earned the right to kick back and opens his own little easy chair (modeled after Chai Rajas) to bask when he spots a beautiful poodle. Boing! Sundars heart goes a-thump and he leaps up all ready to impress the poodle. He bounds over and invites her in all Casanova style  the hotel is his after all for the day- or almost. The poodle is intrigued and agrees but no sooner they take two steps that a street smart handsome hound shows up and decides that the poodle should be his arm candy. Sundar, annoyed tries to impress the poodle with his hotelier skills but the hound manages to downplay or disrupt Sundars serenading by showing off his own street smarts. Basha sees this as a perfect opportunity to lay hands on some fritters and impishly adds to Sundars woes by pranking him. Sundar must now handle both Basha and the hound as he tries to impress his lady love but the tension literally hits the roof and sends everything crashing just as Chai Raja cycles back in. The poodle gives Sundar the cold shoulder and Chai Raja a broom to clean up the mess!</desc>

    <title>Prickly Pair</title>
    <desc>Nino is having a tough time trying to put his daisies up as desired to win the Wonderful Window Box competition that Mayor De Pfeffle is hosting. Deedee cheers him up by saying that flowers can be placed anywhere as long as it makes Abra-Dabra more beautiful. Just then Mewmew runs in all flustered and panicky. The problem seems to be that the creeper plant at Mewmew’s window hasn’t grown big enough to creep all around the heart-shaped support. But Deedee can’t help with magic, as it would be unfair in the competition against everyone else. Charlie loves his display but is being overprotective by shooing the twins away to play ball elsewhere. The twins accidentally throw the ball directly at Uncle Charlie’s display, knocking them all down and breaking them in the process. But there’s no time to fix them up without magic. Deedee brews a magic potion with a few ingredients. The magic potion makes all of Charlie’s flowers into cacti, something Charlie dislikes the most. Since Deedee feels she’s let Charlie down, they all decide to take theor very own flowers to replace Charlie’s exhibit. But with a sudden spelt of rain, all are damaged by the time they reach Charlie’s. But the rain has also caused the cacti to bloom, a rare sight indeed. Mayor De Pfeffle awards Uncle Charlie with the honour of being winner of the Wonderful Window Boz contest. But Charlie wants to share the award with all his friends</desc>

Deedee and Nino find Mewmew trapped in her house strangled tight by huge beanstalks. The only way to pry her free would be to pluck all the beans off the stalks thanks to Tiggy’s suggestion on what to do. But though Mewmew didn’t have much of a garden, hew friends were able to put up a fabulous rock garden that got Mewmew a special recognition star from Mayor De Pfeffle. Just then Tiggy comes along with his special bean soup, much to the delight of everyone, except Mewmew who is a bit overloaded with seeing so many beans that day.</desc>
