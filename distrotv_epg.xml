    <title>Rainbow Reef Relaxation 2</title>
    <desc>Sit back, relax and enjoy the dazzling world of coral reefs in 4K you embark on a journey through some of the most vibrant underwater reefs on our blue planet - including many scenes which no longer look like this due to coral bleaching. From the cinematographer: "The footage for this film was shot over a period of some years in French Polynesia, Micronesia, Indonesia and East Timor. Unfortunately there are not that vibrant anymore today. Coral reefs have suffered from the rise of water temperature, rise in acidity, destructive fishing methods and severe storms caused by climate change." - Peter Schneider.  "Rainbow Reef Relaxation" is a 3-hour long, sweeping yet majestic &amp; vibrant underwater journey to the world's most beautiful lagoons, as captured by Nature Relaxation collaborator Peter Schneider (Underwatercam) paired with ambient underwater sounds and brand new ambient music by the Cynic Project. Filmed in High Definition several years ago, thanks to its age this film offers magical glimpses of an underwater world that is bursting with life, color, and beauty.</desc>

    <title>Myung-whun Chung, Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Coro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino &amp; Christiane Karg - Mahler - Symphony No. 2, 'Resurrection'</title>
    <desc>Maestro Myung-Whun Chung leads the Orchestra and Chorus of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, along with two vocal soloists, in this impressive performance of Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 in C minor, ‘Resurrection’. Soprano Christiane Karg and alto Claudia Huckle are the soloists. Written between 1888 and 1894, this five-movement symphony is scored for a large orchestra, chorus, and soprano and alto soloists. Mahler explores themes of life, death, and resurrection throughout the symphony. Its first movement resembles a funeral march, while the second, a graceful Ländler, creates a stark contrast with the somber character of the first. The third movement is a Scherzo based on Mahler’s musical setting of ‘Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt’ from the collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn. The composer also used another Wunderhorn poem, ‘Urlicht’ (Primal Light), for the fourth movement, incorporating both text and music, sung by the alto. The chorus makes its entrance in the second part of the fifth and final movement with the ‘Resurrection’ chorale. This performance was recorded at Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, Italy, in 2021.</desc>

    <title>Les Arts Florissants &amp; Paul Agnew - Monteverdi - Madrigals, Book I</title>
    <desc>Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) composed nine books of madrigals in half a century, which helped transform the genre from the polyphonic, a cappella madrigals of the late Renaissance to the ‘concertato’ madrigals of the early Baroque, shifting the style’s focus to the ability of music to express emotions contained in a text. In 2011, British tenor Paul Agnew and renowned Baroque ensemble Les Arts Florissants started recording eight books of Monteverdi’s madrigals. In this program, Agnew leads Les Arts Florissants in the madrigals of Book I. Published on New Year’s day of 1587, Book I consist of seventeen madrigals for five voices. This performance was recorded at the Cité de la musique in Paris, France, in 2011.</desc>

It’s often the latter that drive up the majority of Twtich’s numbers with some combination of either skill at a game, or unique content, or tying it all together with their own infectious personalities.While there’s no perfect metric for determining who the most popular Twitch streamers are, usually hours watched is the great equalizer at the top, where the majority of creators are streaming as their primary source of income.

    <title>NEW League of Legends Champion Renata Glasc ABILITIES REVEALED</title>
    <desc>Even though she looks like she was ripped straight out of Arcane, technically, Renata Glasc, the Chem Baroness, wasn’t. She is also apparently not Sevika, despite the robotic arm. But if I was a betting man (and I would like to reiterate for the sake of my employers that I am NOT), I’d put some dough on her being in Season 2 in some way. According to Riot, Renata Glasc “descends from a family of resourceful and altruistic Zaunite alchemists.” But with such banger voice lines as “progress comes at a price others aren’t willing to pay,” and “Work for me, or work against me—doesnt matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually,” odds are that “resourceful” and “altruistic” are euphemisms for something a bit more dastardly.On the Rift, however, Renata Glasc is a support. She’d thematically fall under the umbrella of an enchanter according to what we know about her kit, but she is unlike any enchanter the game has ever seen before, and that’s not an exaggeration.Timecodes:0:00 - Intro0:58 - Passive (Leverage)1:14 - Q (Handshake)1:30 - W (Bailout)2:08 - E (Loyalty Program)2:23 - R (Hostile Takeover)2:48 - OutroFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dotesportsLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dotesportsRead more on our website: http://www.dotesports.comAll Renata Glasc abilities: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-renata-glasc-abilities-in-league-of-legendsMore about Renata Glasc: https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-renata-glasc-as-newest-league-champion</desc>

    <title>La Mer: Dubai's bohemian beachfront</title>
    <desc>Postcards heads down to La Mer, Dubais newest beachfront development to check out the vintage-style beach huts, water sports, restaurants, bars, fashion stores and street art. A magnet for Instagrammers,  La Mer  is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside destinations. The street art here talks to its audience. Visitors can hire a sunbed or rent a whole day room on the sand, and the multi-coloured beach huts house showers. And, if you fancy an ice cream, youll find some interesting flavours.  "Here at  iScream , we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, ketchup, Mexican chilli-chocolate and you name it," says iSreams Managing Partner, Rami Halawi.  ​At the confluence of north and south La Mer, you’ll find  Laguna Water Park . Here you can test your courage on slides knotted with surprise twists and turns, or learn to surf on the 180-degree wave machine by Flowrider.  For more wet and wild adventures, head to the beach – there are two water sports centres with a huge range of activities. Its also possible to explore the coast on a guided jet ski tour.  Those who prefer airborne adventures can bounce around at  Hawa Hawa , the weird and wavy trampoline-like playground imported from Japan.  For those who just want to relax and chill out, dont worry, theres still plenty to do. Before day slips into night, secure a seat with sunset views at one of La Mer’s beautiful beachfront eateries.  Masti  is known for its mixology and its modern Indian cuisine. ​ If thats not enough, La Mer has a vintage-style cinema, fabulous street performers and seasonal celebrations to keep visitors entertained all night long. ​</desc>

    <title>Broken Spanish</title>
    <desc>Theres a distinct image that might pop up in your head when you think of Mexican food. It may involve a puddle of beans next to over-sauced enchiladas. It may involve yellow cheese and crunchy shells. It may involve trucks and outdoor salsa bars. It most likely does not involve crispy skinned pork belly studded with pungent elephant garlic and elegantly strewn with radish sprouts and micro herbs. But maybe it should.Chef Ray Garcia—a born-and-bred Angeleno—is on the forefront of the modern Mexican food movement thats taking over the city, and Broken Spanish is his swanky flagship. The aforementioned CHICHARRON is one of the best large-format meat dishes in a 50-mile radius, while the LAMB NECK TAMAL is all gamey funk and pillowy tender masa. For dessert, the CAFE DE OLLA is a Mexican firing squad of chocolate, beer, and coffee to the face. The hyper-modern space—a mix of retro concrete breezeblocks, macrame, and greenery—is the perfect spot for that mezcal nightcap.</desc>

    <title>Visiting Dubai's many museums</title>
    <desc>Dubai is home to a multitude of museums, from world-firsts to hidden gems.  Quranic Park  is one of the citys brand new attractions. About the size of 60 rugby fields, it has been created to give visitors some green space and a better understanding of Islamic beliefs.   Inside the park’s orchards and Glass House, visitors can discover a variety of healthy and medicinal flora featured in the Holy Quran, from pomegranates and olives, to figs and garlic. Another attraction at Quranic Park is the Cave of Miracles, where seven miracles recounted in the Holy Quran play out on the walls. "The cave was amazing," says Usman, who is visiting from the UK. "We learnt a lot about the miracles growing up, it just gave another understanding to it. And it was great to visualise it, not just hear about it." "This is an open example that the Quran is not just to read in order to get reward but it is something that can be in practical life," says Anwar, a visitor from the US. "This place is beautiful and a very interesting experience for children. Here, they can actually experience things from the Quran," says Miteab, who lives in Saudi Arabia.  Al Shindagha Perfume House From aromatic flora to the UAE’s first museum dedicated to fragrance. The Al Shindagha museum is home to the  Perfume House . Part of a complex created to gather, preserve and share Emirati heritage, Perfume House charts the history and role of fragrance in the region.  Rashed Almuhairi is Perfume House’s Chief Cultural Guide.  “It’s special and important not only for the guests who are coming, he tells Euronews. "It’s for our own generations also. A lot of our youth, they didn’t live in many things like perfuming or pearl diving, so it’s important that they know about our past life. Dubai has a very rich history which needs to be told.” One of the more unusual exhibits on display is a 28 kilogramme piece of oud. Oud is formed in aquilaria trees when they are infected with a particular type of mould. This resinous heartwood is the key ingr</desc>

    <title>Liya Wang</title>
    <desc>The Story of Liya WangThe “Black Pearl” of Taiwan, supermodel Liya Wang, was nicknamed thus due to her dark, tanned complexion; she perfectly embodies the strong, empowered women at the forefront of the fitness movement today. Looking at her million-watt smile now, little would one have guessed that Liya also went through a dark period in her life. When she won the ELLE Model Look competition back in 2005, at the very height of her career, she bid farewell to the life of glitz and glamour and moved to Shanghai to live a quiet life of marital bliss with her then-newly-wed husband, Lin Yongchao. Just two years into the marriage, the once happy couple divorced and went their separate ways. The period that followed was a downward spiral that Liya finds hard to look back upon even now. Yet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she found a new burning passion that reawakened her zest for life - her love of fitness and exercise.Today, Liya has taken time out of her day to tell us her story and recent endeavors. With smooth, sun-kissed skin and minimal make up, Liya flashes us her pearly-whites that remind us of the famous Disney character, Pocahontas. Growing up, becoming a model never crossed Liya’s mind. She perceived her tanned skin and naturally curly hair as against the norm of what was considered aesthetically beautiful, and was naturally surprised when she was approached by a stylist while strolling in Ximending, one of Taipei’s popular shopping districts. The stylist asked her to go in for a casting at Eelin, the model management company in which she is currently still signed to today. As it was Summer break and she had little to do, Liya decided to go to the casting with little expectations, and thus unwittingly began her fifteen-year-long career.It wasn’t all smooth sailing from there, especially the first couple of years into the modelling business. Liya found herself trying to be someone else, fitting into the mold of the successful models before her, afraid to stand out and be herself. Her skin tone, her h</desc>

    <title>Dubai's coolest indoor attractions offer a break from the summer heat</title>
    <desc>Dubai is known for its year-round sunshine and blue skies but sometimes opting for an indoor attraction can offer a break from the heat. This feature of Life takes you on a tour of the best under-cover attractions the city has to offer. The Green Planet One indoor attraction on offer is The Green Planet - a man-made rainforest that is home to over 3000 species of plants and animals. The unique structure is designed specifically to be the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals despite being in the middle of the Dubai desert. There are a range of attractions at the Green Planet - most notably the piranha tank where over 1,000 of the fish are on display. Once a day at 16:00 visitors can see a  feeding session . Piranhas are notorious for their razor sharp teeth and carnivorous eating habits. Other attractions include the Australian Walkabout - a multi-species exhibit featuring the Australian carpet python, white tree frogs, the lace goanna lizard residing in an abandoned plane and many more. Housing plants and animals from such a contrasting climate to Dubais requires sophisticated technology. Sara Stevens is the curator of The Green Planet: "The glass for the windows was imported from overseas to be 82 UV penetrable to allow for all those nutrients to come in. Even the misting system is digital and automatic to make sure that if the humidity drops below  80 percent  in the building it sprays on every level to provide the perfect environment for all the animals." Sara Stevens said the facility is a chance for young people to learn about conservation first-hand: "It’s one thing to of course learn about conservation in the classroom but it’s another to come here, experience a bird flying by you, a sloth next to you and see where the ginger, vanilla or chocolate that you eat comes from and the plants that are there and then learn how important it is to conserve." iFly Dubai If you have always wanted to experience the feeling of skydiving without having to jump out of a plane or off of a cli</desc>

    <title>Animal conservation "a government priority" says United Arab Emirates</title>
    <desc>Dubai and the United Arab Emirates are making animal conservation a government priority at a time when biodiversity is under threat and more animals face extinction globally. A report by the United Nations earlier this year claimed animal extinctions are at an unprecedented high. According to the organisation, as many as one million species are under threat.  On a visit to the desert, you might expect to find camels or antelope, maybe some hawks. But Dubai’s Al Marmoom animal sanctuary is teeming with biodiversity with hundreds of different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The sanctuary covers 20 percent of the whole area of Dubai. In the beginning, it was a desert populated by native animals, but as the sanctuary expanded to more than 50 oases, it was discovered  these water bodies could control the environmental balance. The sanctuary has even managed to attract the Arabian Oryx. This animal was declared extinct in the wild in 1972, but has now been brought back from the brink by the reserve. Saoud Faisal is a wildlife officer at the Al Marmoom sanctuary. He says in the 80s and 90s the Oryx were overhunted for food. Now the animal is considered part of the regions wildlife. “They are totally protected now and also they are healthy,” he explains. “We have them in large numbers which last year reached more than 500." From desert oases to indoor tropical environments, recent laws in Dubai mean greater governmental support for animal sanctuaries.  Laws were introduced in 2007 to cover animal welfare, but awareness really started to build in 2016.  The laws also apply to rare and exotic animals. Some are looked after in animal sanctuaries like Green Planet. Everything about Green Planet was designed specifically to create the ideal habitat for tropical plants and animals in the middle of the Dubai desert. The sanctuary houses a wide range of species including many different birds, and mammals such as two-toed sloths. And lizards like green iguanas or basilisks. The latest addition t</desc>

    <desc>At its core Tulum is a vibrant mix of extremely old and extremely new. Prehistoric natural wonders and ancient Mayan ruins are scattered among world-class resorts slinging more fresh lobster and mezcal than the human body is probably meant to consume. Long known for its yoga retreats and rustic eco-hotels, the off-the-grid Tulum of 15 years ago is still there, but it now exists alongside thrumming nightlife and unparalleled culinary adventures. Chefs and mixologists from around the globe have been lured to Tulum by its beachside DGAF vibe and a willingness to rewrite the rules. There are plenty of destination-worthy bars and clubs near the city’s central Hotel Zone, but if you want to escape the glitz—or maybe civilization itself—plunge into one of the region’s underground swimming caves formed millions of years ago, believed by Mayans to be a passage to another dimension. With breathtaking beaches, history you can touch, and a unique kind of artistic-inspired luxury, Tulum is whatever you want it to be. Oh, and there are lots of tequila and tacos, too. Do take advantage of that.</desc>

    <title>Why day-trippers and holidaymakers are hooked on Dubai Marina</title>
    <desc>The glories of Dubai Marina  Dubai Marina  is much more than just a glamorous urban dock for luxury yachts (although its that as well!) Its also home to a huge range of chic bars and restaurants to suit all tastes and moods. And, of course, it has those iconic towers that define its famous skyline. One of the best ways to admire the architecture around Dubai Marina is from the deck of a boat. You can charter a private yacht, hop onboard an organised boat tour - or you can even cross the marina for as little as €2 in a water taxi. Five-star resorts hug the coastline. Their vast, marble-clad lobbies lead to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunch venues and postcard-perfect beaches. As for Dubai Marinas beach clubs, from  Drift  to  Zero Gravity , they are dizzyingly beautiful; their pool decks are catwalks for the latest swimwear fashions. Jumereirah Beach Residence Jumeirah Beach Residence  itself is the largest single-phase commercial and residential project in the world. Its strategically lined along a chic waterfront strip known as  The Walk , feautring stunning 3D murals. The Walk has a very varied range of fashion, home and handicraft shops and boutiques. The outdoor pop-up market stalls offer jewellery, food treats and homeware, as well as performances by street entertainers.  Jumereirah Beach Residence is made up of 40 high-rise buildings divided into six clusters, all with superb access to first-class retailers, entertainment venues and restaurants.  Up on the Flying Cup The adjacent cosmopolitan shopping area  The Beach  has many attractions, including the floating adventure park  Aqua Fun . This amazing water park makes a statement, by spelling out "I ♡ Dubai" via is pools and slides when seen from above.  Another highlight at The Beach is  The Flying Cup , a ride that you can sit in and be elevated to fabulous views, seen in all their glory from 40 metres up - while eating and drinking! From the top, you can see Ain Dubai, Palm Jumeirah and, of course, that wonderful Duba</desc>

    <title>Did you know Dubai is fifth most instagrammed city in the world?</title>
    <desc>Dubai has been named the 5th most Instagrammed city in the world in a survey by travel site Wego. From its sweeping beaches, to standout architecture and world class restaurants, there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact, food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the food category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72,000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden, downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame, an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high, 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan, Managing Director, MENA and India, Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations,” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million, followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Moscow, and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational," she explains. "It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So, you’re looking for something that is bright, that real</desc>

    <title>Kanda</title>
    <desc>One way to think about Kanda is to picture early Brooklyn, before the hipsters completely took over. It’s a place that perfectly embodies old and new Tokyo, a university town that attracts more than students. It’s a great place to live (some even think it’s one of the best kept secrets of Tokyo) with just about everything you need in one place — restaurants, nightlife, shopping, and easy access to just about any other part of the city. While tall gleaming skyscrapers haven’t taken over the landscape like much of Tokyo, there’s a good balance of historical and contemporary architecture to keep things interesting.Walk around and you’ll find neighborhood pockets that focusing on one thing: an entire street of used bookstores, another with stores and stores hawking vintage and new guitars; a three-story mecca for old-school arcade games; an entire block for ski and snowboarding gear. You can find Michelin-starred restaurants, gyoza specialists, internationally known ramen shops, and even great burger joints around the corner from each other. With friendly and fiercely proud locals who want to share the area’s history, from origami to the Kanda Myojin Shrine, this is a quieter part of Tokyo just waiting to be discovered.</desc>

    <title>Why visitors are hooked on Dubai Marina, home to luxury yachts, docks, hotels and beach clubs</title>
    <desc>Whether you see it from the deck of a boat or the wire of its 1km zipline, Dubai Marina is a spectacle of ground-breaking architecture, bespoke superyachts and luxury shoreline hospitality.  This sought-after holiday destination encompasses the coastal neighbourhood of Jumeirah Beach Residence, known locally as JBR, home to retail and entertainment developments The Walk and The Beach, which multiple the attractions for fun-seekers.  Iconic five-star hotels hug the shoreline, their vast marble lobbies leading to some of Dubai’s most famous weekend brunches and postcard-perfect beaches.  Le Méridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina  is one of the longest-standing hotels in Dubai Marina with 500 metres of private Arabian Gulf coastline providing a playground for water sports enthusiasts.  Local expats regularly fill the resort’s  Barasti  bar, restaurant and beach club. A Dubai institution in its second decade, this well-liked venue has grown into a sprawling sports and beach bar with open-air screenings and food stalls, and the only free-entry beach club in town. Despite progression, Barasti retains its original theme, defined by palm fronds typically found in the traditional barasti shelters favoured by the early Bedouins. Other Dubai Marina beach clubs that draw crowds include  Drift  to  Zero Gravity . Drift is dizzyingly beautiful; its pool deck, a catwalk for the latest swimwear fashions. Open until late, Zero Gravity is known for its high-octane parties and voyeuristic glass-sided pool.  Sun worshippers on Dubai Marina’s deep sandy beaches pose for photos that frame its remarkable urban skyline. It’s a backdrop that’s hard to miss, containing some of the tallest residential towers in the world. The 101-storey Princess Tower once claimed the title of the highest, while the Cayan Tower retains its record for the world’s tallest building with a 90-degree twist; it’s structure akin to a giant corkscrew.

    <title>Balloon trip gives passengers a real bird’s eye view of the desert</title>
    <desc>Ballooning is the earliest form of human flight. In 18th century France, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette watched as the first passengers - a duck, a rooster and a sheep -  took off in one  from Versailles . These days it’s a big attraction for tourists the world over. But in Dubai, hot air ballooning comes with a twist. You can fly with a peregrine falcon. Falconer Dylan Freeman says its the only place in the world where you can fly with the fastest animal on the planet. “What were trying to simulate here is having the falcon soaring.  “Theyve been recorded reaching speeds of 389 km/h in a dive. From one kilometre up he can see a pigeon four kilometres away. So then he would fly above it, fold up his wings, and dive down really quickly to try and catch it.”  Peter Kollar, co-founder and chief pilot of  Balloon Adventures Dubai , says dawn is a good time to take to the skies. “Its a beautiful area because its a mix of desert, pristine desert …… and there are green oases in the desert, which gives a beautiful contrast.”  Kollar says the route the balloon takes is very much up to the weather. “Eighty per cent of my work is meteorology. If we get the weather right my job is relatively simple. Really ballooning is true flying because you have to use Mother Nature.”</desc>

    <title>The Story of the Zhonghe Animal Shelter</title>
    <desc>The Story of the Zhonghe Animal Shelter In Taiwan, the issue of homeless animals has been a cause for concern for many years, and even in the capital city of Taipei, stray dogs and cats are a common sight. Taiwan saw a rise in abandoned animals during the 1980’s, during a time of economic growth. Residents who were uninformed of the responsibilities that comes with raising a pet, eventually abandoned said animals on the streets. Today, we have invited Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor, model and humanitarian, to interview the Director of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The setting is at the Zhonghe Animal Shelter, a place that has truly become a haven for stray dogs in recent years.Operating under the government of New Taipei City, Zhonghe Animal Shelter seeks to provide unwanted dogs with the safest and best care they can afford. Upon entering their care, every animal will be given vaccination, a health screening, de-worming, microchip implantation, and are spayed or neutered. Depending on their gender, male dogs will receive a mark on the left ear, while females are marked on the right ear. Once the process is finished, these dogs are ready for adoption.While there are other breeds at the animal shelter, their stay is never long since they get adopted rather swiftly, leaving the shelter with a 90 majority of the Formosan Mountain Dog, or more simply known as, Taiwanese Dog. The characteristics of the Taiwanese dog breed include a triangular face, agile feet that are known for their hopping skill, and a sickle tail. The personality of the Formosan is loyal, intelligent, affectionate and understanding. “These dogs are suited for being hunting or search dogs, so the current feeding rate for these dogs is quite high. We mainly have black ones, but we also have brown and yellow ones,” says the Director.Currently, most, if not all the dogs at the Shelter have been desexed. This ‘zero-kill’ plan started on the 1st of March last year, under the guidance of the mayor of New Taipei City, Zhu Li Luen. Howeve</desc>

    <title>From kayaking to fitness workouts: Dubai enriches its offer for the health conscious traveller</title>
    <desc>With its untamed environment and rugged landscape, Hatta is the picture-perfect destination. And this centuries’ old exclave of Dubai also caters for today’s health conscious traveller.  High up in the Hajar mountains you can soak up the history while doing a spot of hiking.  There are 32 kilometres of track in the area. More than a dozen possible routes have been mapped out, with four different levels of ability. Kayaking is also on offer on the vast lake next to the Hatta dam. Fitness expert and Youtube star Lilly Sabri  @lillysabri  says the walking is an ideal complement to a regular routine. “I think that when you’re on a holiday you want to make memories as well… so trying different things,” she says. “So, if you’re someone goes to the gym wherever you normally train and in whatever country that might be, it might be nice to try something different. So, getting outside. You certainly couldn’t do this in London where I’m originally from. So, it’s keeping fit and healthy but in a different way.”  Wellness tourism has evolved to become the travel industry’s fastest growing sector – something Dubai is continuing to expand upon and develop. Across town amongst the shimmering Jumeirah Lakes Towers you will find the SMSF Heartfulness Meditation Centre. It’s the only one of its kind in the MENA region and they hold daily meditation classes that attract up to 500 people. “I think we just forgot where... we’ve been so focused on external gratification... now people are actually zoning in and they realise what’s important on how we feel and how we can impact on those around us,” says fitness expert Christian Williams. “This place in Dubai is not just where people live, it’s a stop off where people go on vacation. So, what we’re doing here in Heartfulness Meditation is just incredible not just for people living here but anyone who is willing to come and travel. And I can just see us moving forwards and I’m just so pleased I came to this centre because it’s free and it’s on every single week.” “Dubai is gr</desc>

    <title>La Mer, Dubai’s newest beachfront neighbourhood, offers hip restaurants, water sports and fun parks</title>
    <desc>With the construction of Dubai’s latest luxury residential development,  Port de La Mer by Meraas , and new hotel,  Rove La Mer , La Mer is a of rising interest in today’s property market. La Mer, open since 2017, is one of Dubai’s most colourful seaside neighbourhoods, nestled on the northern shoreline. Divided into two areas, La Mer South and La Mer North, it’s defined by its retro Californian style. The Instagram-friendly destination offers a heady mix of water sports, fun parks, fashionable restaurants, street art and seasonal parties after dark. By day, visitors can hire sunbeds or rent wooden day rooms on La Mer Beach. The multi-coloured beach huts house showers. La Mer beach club,  Train , is fully licensed with a shisha area, but its name is derived from its fitness facilities – it has a gym and a boxing and yoga studio – and its Origin 33 restaurant and lounge also serves healthy meals and a menu of fresh juices and smoothies. The best restaurants in La Mer, according to local award-givers, include  Masti , a beachfront eatery applauded for its modern Indian cuisine, innovative mixology and eclectic interior design by Studio Lotus. The name Masti is derived from the Hindi word for fun and mischief and the décor and dishes live up to the name, with cheeky monkey artwork and playful fusions for the palate such as the tandoori chicken bao. Another creative culinary outlet is  iScream . Managing Partner Rami Halawi came up with the concept for iScream with his family. Offering a wide selection of unusual flavours is the brand’s unique selling point. “Here at iScream, we’re very crazy; thats why we have crazy flavours like curry, kulfi, tabbouleh, ketchup and Mexican chilli-chocolate,” says Rami. On certain days, customers are invited to scream into a sound monitor for their ice cream – if they beat the highest recording in decibels, they win their ice cream for free. La Mer’s shops focus on beach pursuits and accessories, making it a good place to shop for swimwear, sunglasses, suntan lotion</desc>

    <title>Sak Yant Tattoo</title>
    <desc>Traditional hand needle tattoos have been a staple of Thai culture for centuries with the common practitioners being Buddhist monks. Why? The spiritual significance and meanings behind the permanent body art are manifestations of the individual’s aura. Ajarn Noo, a former Buddhist monk turned spiritual Thai tattoo master, has gained international recognition since tattooing Angelina Jolie and consequently many other celebrities like Michele Rodriguez and David Beckham. His tattoo parlor is unlike any you’ve ever been to because he performs the spiritual practice in the sanctuary of his own home. Walk past the larger than life statues devoted to Buddha, up the stairs and into the top floor of his residence There you will find photos adorning his walls of countless celebrities, the royal family and others who have come before you. You can than evaluate your various options but here is the kicker – there is no guarantee you will get the tattoo you are looking for. You must first stand before Ajarn Noo for a spiritual evaluation and based on each individual’s aura, Ajarn Noo will either approve and customize a tattoo for you based on your own spirit or send you packing. So come with a clear heart, a clear mind and let your inner soul speak to Ajarn in hopes of a tattoo blessing that will be unlike any other.</desc>

    <title>The Bankruptcy Boom &amp; The Golden Age of Fraud</title>
    <desc>2023 is going to finish up as the worst year for corporate bankruptcies since the end of the Global Financial Crisis. This year has also claimed the two biggest bankruptcies in American history that didn’t occur during the GFC and if that’s got you feeling nervous, don’t worry, according to the numbers 2024 is going to be much worse. According to data from Standard &amp; Poor’s, corporate bankruptcies in the major companies they track were up over 200 in the first half of 2023. High profile companies like wework, Vice Media and Bed Bath and Beyond all went under due to a combination of poor management, changing consumer preferences, high interest rates and bad market conditions. But what does this even mean? Even though these companies went bankrupt Vice is still making videos, you can still rent a office from WeWork, and Bed Bath and Beyond is still selling overpriced laundry hampers. Bankruptcies just aren’t what they used to be anymore and now instead of being the corporate equivalent of game over, it’s just another business strategy, which is just one of four reasons why it’s become so popular. Now you all know I hate videos from supposed experts with wide open mouths peddling some doomer, but the other three reasons why bankruptcies are on the rise are honestly worrying and they also show why business leaders just don’t take it seriously anymore. The first reason that bankruptcies are booming is because of a new investing strategy that rewards taking on as much risk as possible. Private equity is a broad classification of investing that just means putting money into companies that are not publicly listed on any securities exchange. Venture capitalists who invest in early startups are a type of private equity, all of the deals you watch get made on shark tank are private equity deals… if you give your family member a few thousand dollars to get their Etsy store going in exchange for a cut of their future profits you are technically a private equity investor, so make sure to slap that on your LinkedIn profile.

    <title>Dumb People are Earning More &amp; Hidden Billionaires</title>
    <desc>Dumb people make more money than smart people and it took a study conducted by really smart people to prove it. A study out of Sweden has found that top earners have lower intelligence than the people in income levels directly below them. The Plateauing of cognitive ability among top earners drew on data from 59,000 men who had to take a compulsory military conscription aptitude test. It then tracked their earnings over their professional careers to find the relationship between intelligence and income. Before Tai Lopez gets any ideas for more shitty YouTube commercials or the hustle bros learn how to read journal articles and use this to encourage people to drop out of college, I want you all to know how this data really works. The relationship between intelligence and income was strong, smarter people earnt more money but only up to six hundred and seventy thousand Swedish krona or sixty-four thousand dollars per year. After that intelligence didn’t mean much anymore and at the very top end of income earners, the 1, dumber people actually did better. So is this a sign that watching TikTok and reality TV is actually better for your career than going to college? Well maybe actually, for two important reasons but there are also two reasons why you should probably ignore this and keep studying hard if you want to get ahead financially. Reason number one why dumb people are doing better than smart people is that smart people fill in high prestige jobs that don’t have high salaries. Academics and research scientists are some of the smartest people in the world, but they don’t get paid well. Doctors, lawyers and elite financiers also need to be very smart to get through demanding schooling and admission exams and these professionals ARE typically compensated very competitively BUT most of them don’t make it all the way into the 1. In the USA to be in the top 1 of income earners an individual needs to make at least five hundred and ninety-seven thousand dollars before tax and that’s just the minimum to join the 1 c</desc>

    <title>Ice Edge</title>
    <desc>Ice Edge is a short documentary about a group of surfers trying to make surfboards out of ice. It follows the process from freezing the boards, shaping them and taking them out into the sea. There is a lot of trying and failing. Will it work at all? The boards are slippery, and they melt very fast. Everything needs to work simultaneously: The surfers must be ready. The boards cannot crack. The perfect wave must come. Ice Edge is a film where nature and people play together.</desc>

    <desc>Tasmanian climbers Liz Oh and Rosie Hohnen are persuaded by filmmaker Olivia Page and a local kiwi stoat trapper, Ana Richards, to hike off-track deep into remote Fiordland, New Zealand, in search of a sabre-like peak. They surrender themselves to Ana's confidence in navigating them through terrain few have crossed, and in parts never traversed at all. They battle through vertical plants, gale force storms and dangerously loose rock - but not without humor.</desc>

    <title>Orders up</title>
    <desc>Business is good and Chai Raja is grinning wider with each ring of the cash register. His mood gets a further lift as a guy in a black suit (an agent) enters with a briefcase marked Top Secret. As Sundar delivers tea to the agent, he is intrigued by the briefcase. Basha chooses to make off with the snacks of the customer at the adjacent table at that very minute. Sundar leaps at Basha and in his hurry upsets the agents plate and tea, knocking down the briefcase. Chai Raja is immediately at agents side, apologizing- he absently picks the briefcase back up(not noticing a fallen plate-like device) and gives it to the agent. The annoyed agent leaves and Sundar gets extra chores as punishment. Basha cant help taunt Sundar as he is stuck doing the chores- In a fit of anger, Sundar chases Basha back into the hotel and randomly hurls the plate like device. Before the chase can continue though, Sundar is sharply reprimanded and hauled off by Chai Raja. Basha meanwhile finds the object that Sundar had just thrown a tad bizarre and pokes around. Lo! It turns out to be a gadget that can make just about anything levitate! Chuckling impishly, Basha sets off towards the hotel, gadget at ready intent on helping Sundar get every order UP! The chaos gets out of hand when Basha sends the device into overdrive and is himself lifted off and bounced around. In the end however, the agent returns and reclaims the device much to the relief of all who drop back down.</desc>

    <title>Shy Tommy Prickles</title>

They soon invite all of Abra-Dabra, but Tommy Prickles isn’t so keen on attending, because he feels so very shy. But as Deedee doesn’t have any spell to make Tommy’s shyness go away she improvises without magic by making Tommy believe that she has cast a spell on Tommy’s hat. Tommy agrees to attend the party in the guise that the hat he is wearing is now a chatter hat that will help him talk to others at the party. Nino is confused as he’s happy on one side that magic wasn’t used but sad that Tommy thinks magic is used. Tommy Prickles fits right in at the party and has fun playing with the Doobydoos and talks so freely and happily with everyone. Just then a huge gust of wind ruffles everything including Tommy’s hat. Poor sad Tommy feels so shy and helpless that he wants to go back home. But Deedee implores him to stay by trying to make him hopeful that Nino would return soon with Tommy’s hat. Tommy slumps on the ground and won’t budge, not until Deedee gets Tommy to don Tiggy’s baker hat. Tommy jumps springs back up and rounds all the party goers to teach them his very own special Wiggly Worm dance. Just then as they all dance in a bee-line behind Tommy, Nino flies in with Tommy’s hat. A confused Tommy discovers that he was wearing Tiggy’s hat till then and is flabbergasted to know that Deedee didn’t work any magic into the hat all along. Tommy Prickles runs away crying. Tommy reasons with Deedee that all of Abra-Dabra will think of him as silly, but Deedee tells him that if he couldn’t believe her, then to at least believe those who love having him along. Tommy looks up to see all his friends walking up to him doing the Wiggly Worm dance. Tommy takes a brave step and listens to his friends wanting have him back. He joins them just the way he is, without his ‘magic’ hat. Deedee finally agrees with Nino that sometimes no magic is good.</desc>

    <desc>Mewmew is setting up his garden in such a way to get a Gardening Star from Mayor De Pfeffle. Usually Tiggy wins them every year and he’s optimistic to win it this year as well. As Tiggy says the secret lies in the beans, Mewmew rushes off to freshly plant exactly that from just seeds. But Mewmew is impatient to wait till next year which calls for Deedee’s magic. Deedee puts a spell of ‘grow faster’ on the beans making them sprout soon enough. The next morning Mayor De Pfeffle polishes the Gardening Star to a shining bright sparkle, then sets off to inspect. Deedee and Nino find Mewmew trapped in her house strangled tight by huge beanstalks. The only way to pry her free would be to pluck all the beans off the stalks thanks to Tiggy’s suggestion on what to do. But though Mewmew didn’t have much of a garden, hew friends were able to put up a fabulous rock garden that got Mewmew a special recognition star from Mayor De Pfeffle. Just then Tiggy comes along with his special bean soup, much to the delight of everyone, except Mewmew who is a bit overloaded with seeing so many beans that day.</desc>

Deedee and Nino are surprised to hear him sing and sets up a proposition for Mewmew to sing at the concert hall with Tiggy’s lemonade stand nearby. The concert is all set and so is Tiggy’s lemonade stand. Mewmew is parched with practising so long and is totally refreshed with Tiggy’s minty lemonade, but it turns out he’s got the hiccups. All the conjured tactics to beat the hiccups, including Tiggy’s super sour lemon lime sherbet fizzerade doesn’t seem to work. Only magic seems to stop this stubborn bout of hiccups in time for the concert. The spell works on Mewmew but backfires and the bubblecordion gets a fit of hiccups. Mewmew is so sad, but it turns out that the townsfolk are mesmerized by the bubbles. Alas, the bubbles are about to tip over Tiggy’s lemonade stand. Suddenly the blaring horns of Tika Pila gives everybody a shock of surprise, even the bubblecordion that the hiccups come to a halt. Now that the lemonade stand is safe, lemonade is served all around. Mewmew is all set for the concert, which surprisingly ends with a sneeze.</desc>

But with Tiggy having prepared all the delectable dishes and only one hour to get them to the venue and Deedee rushing to invite everybody; Deedee decides to use some magic for the timebeing. On sprinkling some of her ‘light as air’ magic powder on the plates and Nino stringing them together as the master knots-man he is, Tiggy is able to walk them over to town-hall like a bunch of balloons. Deedee and Nino get to invite Charlie and the twins just when Boris misfires his new fishing dart gun onto Uncle Charlie causing him to fall out of his hammock. The Doobydoos and Mewmew are playing together by trying to find which group can make the tallest team-tower, just when Deedee and Nino invites them for the party. Back at town-hall Mayor De Pfeffle and Tiggy create a floating food game, but Tiggy reminds the Mayor that he isn’t good at tying knots. When the guests arrive, Mayor De Pfeffle and Tiggy usher them in and tell them how to play the game, but discover that all the strings have loosened themselves and are floating high up near the ceiling. Deedee improvises and gets the twins to use their toy dart guns to pull the food-laden plates to themselves. The Doobydoos along with Mewmew make really tall team-towers and pull their jelly plates to themselves with glee. Nino pulls down a plate that happens to be a bowl of custard. Nino gets drenched in custard, but in a very delicious way.</desc>

    <title>Mood Music</title>
    <desc>Deedee and Nino hear the most horrible sounds ever and run out to find Mewmew playing his violin. And to top it off he’s inviting everyone to hear him play at the concert. Deedee encourages Mewmew along, but everyone turns her down after hearing what Mewmew plays. Tiggy throws a shoe at Mewmew mistaking the music for cats screeching, even the Doobydoos scram. Tika Pila is also enraged that Mewmew walks away so dejected. Deedee weaves a spell that makes the violin plays with so much emotion that Nino sheds a tear. Now Mewmew has to muster her spirit and prove to all of Abra-Dabra that she can really play well. First stop is at Tiggy’s, and when Mewmew plays a melancholic tune, Tiggy cries so much that Mewmew walks away sadly. The Doobydoos cry as well to the point that Mewmew totally hates what Deedee has conjured. Deedee and Nino notice that Mewmew’s violin plays according to the state of Mewmew’s emotions. Deedee and Nino devise a plan and Nino keeps Mewmew happy and practising while Deedee rounds up the townsfolk to attend the concert. Charlie goes to get the twins, but takes a quick nap instead. Though all take a while to come, Deedee and Nino lift Mewmew’s spirits so high that the entire town come rushing to the concert on hearing the joyful music Mewmew is playing. And even thought the magic spell wears off, the town still encourage Mewmew to keep on playing, for she had already proved the very best to all of them.</desc>

Deedee cheers him up by saying that flowers can be placed anywhere as long as it makes Abra-Dabra more beautiful. Just then Mewmew runs in all flustered and panicky. The problem seems to be that the creeper plant at Mewmew’s window hasn’t grown big enough to creep all around the heart-shaped support. But Deedee can’t help with magic, as it would be unfair in the competition against everyone else. Charlie loves his display but is being overprotective by shooing the twins away to play ball elsewhere. The twins accidentally throw the ball directly at Uncle Charlie’s display, knocking them all down and breaking them in the process. But there’s no time to fix them up without magic. Deedee brews a magic potion with a few ingredients. The magic potion makes all of Charlie’s flowers into cacti, something Charlie dislikes the most. Since Deedee feels she’s let Charlie down, they all decide to take theor very own flowers to replace Charlie’s exhibit. But with a sudden spelt of rain, all are damaged by the time they reach Charlie’s. But the rain has also caused the cacti to bloom, a rare sight indeed. Mayor De Pfeffle awards Uncle Charlie with the honour of being winner of the Wonderful Window Boz contest. But Charlie wants to share the award with all his friends</desc>
